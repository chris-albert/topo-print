# PROMPT
Lets build a web app called Topo Print. 

It will be able to take google map coordinates and produce an stl file for 3D printing. The interface should allow you to search and refine your map coordinates and then simply supply a download STL button. Create a nice modern UI please.

You should use the following technologies:
 - React Typescript
 - Tailwind css
 - pnpm
 - Turborepo
 - TanStack router

This app will be deployed with github pages, so please add the nessesary actions to publish this.
